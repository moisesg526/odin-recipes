<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty,
  made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more
  traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's
  recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. I have
  found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic
  bread.
